1.My visualizations show "How does enrollment by class(Freshman, Sophomore,...)  for females who declare STEM majors change upon enrollment"
2 and 3.The research question for visualization 4 came up by group discussion. Then I selected the corresponding data set that might answer the question. After manipulating the multiple data attributes.
I used the existing attributes to produce the visualization to answer the research question. 
4.I made v4. 
5.JupyterNote book shows the detail about how data attribute was selected, the "Visualization4" shows my final work.
